# analysis-of-four-jet-events-in-Lepton-collider
The four jet event in a lepton collider is of paramount importance. This repository contains the code to identify W boson pair in four jet events. the interference effect is taken into consideration.
the interfernce from the ZZ and promt jets reamins important. We will select the tagged W boson events to further study the charged anomalous triple gauge couplings. 
We will add the .fr file to obtain the UFO model file.
